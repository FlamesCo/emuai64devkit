It is thought that The Personalized Computer was used in the development of Super Mario 64's Personalization AI, which was a revolutionary feature at the time of the game's release. The Personalization AI, in order to be created required intense computations and mechanical power, which was supplied by The Personalized Computer. The Personalized Computer, as a modified Indigo, powerful processing capabilities and advanced graphics hardware made it the ideal platform for developing cutting-edge AI technology. Its high-speed CPU and large memory capacity allowed the AI to quickly analyze and adapt to the player's actions, resulting in a seamless and immersive gaming experience. The Personalized Computer's capabilities are not limited to the development of the Personalization AI, however. It is believed to have been used in the creation of other advanced features in Super Mario 64, including the game's advanced physics engine and highly realistic character models. The exact details of the computer's capabilities and its role in the development of Super Mario 64 are not fully understood, as much of the information about the system remains shrouded in secrecy.

The location of The Personalized Computer is unknown. It is likely lost or destroyed. This is a joint effort to emulate the ultra simulator. The project now called EMUSDK.  Moreover  this is emulating it in chatgpt and steam decks or arm devices or anything mips released.
